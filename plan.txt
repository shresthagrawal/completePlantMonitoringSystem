(Caution: I have totally new to ELK stack and so their might be a lot features and ideas which I can use in this project but I dont even know about it. I think so I will get to know them as I explore the stack while immplementing the below features :->)

Planned Features for the Node

# Every node device will have a unique id, and a grid location.
# Every node will use DNS-SD so that it that it requires Zeroconf and nodes can easily know the features available on the other node
# Every node will send the sensor values timeStamped for Indexing to the ELK stack.
# The Node will get Action packet on realtime which will give the most optimal actions to be performed. 


Planned features for the ELK Stack

# as soon as the data is arived either using python or logstash input sensor data and output the action data.
# this action data will be generated using a NN, which will be trained using reinforcement learning. The reward function will check the mean squared differece between the ideal condition of a paticular farm with actual condition after an action takes place.
# To train the NN initially I will use a simulated env generated by py-bullet (a physics engine in python) and then after it has reached a certain accuracy use it on the field.  

Planned features for Visualization in Kibana

# create a 3d heat map of how temperature changes over time for the whole node. cordinates of the node in x,y axis, time in z axis and temp with color green and red.
# similarly foe humidity.
# find the abnormalities in real time data from all previous data(I dont know how this can be done). 
# check for the max and min of some values (like temp) over a couse of multiple nodes with time series
