# In this project I have tried to extend the Task of the GPIO pins. All the Sensor Configurations are same. Just Instead of Arduino uno I have used Arduino Due. the Arduino Due is also connected to NodeMCU over serial connection. Their are seperate code for both of the boards, I had to use two boards as I had no board with 5 adc pins and Network Connection. The server is ELK Stack which seted up on docker. The node mcu will first get all the sensor values then get the time using the world time api, parse them together and send it to the elastic search Indexing API.

# Then using the Kibana I have created simple dashboard to visualize the data on REALTIME. To replicate the project please refer to README.txt. Currenty I am working with one module but I plan to create a stack of this monitoring device aranged on grid format in the farming fields pumping all the enviromental conditions and then getting realtime feedback on actions for optimal outcome. I have also create a small plan sheet (plan.txt available in the repo's main dir) on how I am going totake this forward. I would be really greatfull if you read it and give reviews upon it.

# Just their is one small problem; currently I am in berlin, and I dont have access to all of the sensors I used while I did the GPIO pin task in India. I just have PIR sensor, the Node MCU and DUE Board, LDR, and a few LEDs. I have attached them all and created the circuit (Images attached below), I am sure that if all the other sensors are attached the code will not break as I have already tested it on the GPIO pins task and I have made very few changes to that code. Secondly Just for testing the Kibana and creating the visualization for the task I have used a random function to assign values to sensors.
